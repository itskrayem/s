    <h1>I Love You</h1>
    <h3>Isn't love wonderful?</h3>

    <p style="color: white;">In your eyes, I found my light,
        <br>
        In your smile, my world feels right.
        <br>
        Your touch is warmth, your words are song,
        <br>
        With you, my heart forever belongs.
        <br><br>
        
        Hand in hand, through life we'll go,
        <br>
        Love's gentle breeze, like a river's flow.
        <br>
        In your embrace, I've found my place,
        <br>
        A love so sweet, time can't erase.
        <br><br>
        Simple joys, shared laughter too,
        <br>
        All I need is me and you.
        <br>
        In every moment, our love will bloom,<br>
        Forever together, chasing away the gloom.</p>
